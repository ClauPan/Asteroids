# ASTEROIDS

Highscore based game divided into 3 levels of difficulty with the player having 3 lives. 
One life in minus means the ship was hit by an asteroid.To pass to the next level you need 
to hit 10 + level -1 asteroids. Each level has different size asteroids with different speed 
different number of hits necessary to kill. The higher the level the more hits to blow up the 
asteroids. Once level 3 is finished, the game will continue with level 3 difficulty, but the 
asteroids will increase their speed untill the player makes a mistake and dies.
